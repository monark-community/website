        ## General Description

        [CoopDAO](https://coopdao.monark.io) is a decentralized operating system for cooperatives, designed to help small groups, associations, or communities organize transparently without traditional bureaucratic overhead. In its core implementation, the project will enable wallet-based membership registration, proposal submission, voting, and shared treasury management. These features allow cooperatives to operate like digital DAOs while still serving real-world usersâ€”whether farmers, local collectives, mutual aid networks, or student-led initiatives.
        
        The platform allows members to submit proposals (e.g., budget allocation, new hires, project launches), vote based on agreed-upon rules, and execute treasury transactions in a secure and auditable way. Smart contracts manage roles, permissions, and proposal logic, while the frontend UI ensures accessibility and inclusivity across digital literacy levels.
        
        An important component of CoopDAO is the integration of reputation or trust metrics to reward consistent, meaningful participation. Students may explore tokenized membership, role-based voting weights, and rotating committee roles. On the treasury side, expenses can be proposed, peer-reviewed, and approved through a multi-signature system to prevent abuse.
        
        By simulating and testing the inner workings of digital co-ops, this project will give students firsthand experience in DAO tooling, group psychology, and financial coordination. In the long term, CoopDAO could serve as the backend for real-world cooperative platforms seeking modernization through decentralized infrastructure.

        ## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

        - Web interface using Next.js, Typescript, shadcn-ui, tailwindcss
        - User authentication 
        - Smart contracts for wallet-based member registration and proposal voting
        - Multi-signature treasury spending system
        - Admin role assignment and access control
        - Interface for proposing and reviewing expenses
        - On-chain member lists and participation tracking
        - (Optional) IPFS document storage

        ## Required Resources

        - Web hosting platform (Vercel)
        - Database (Clickhouse, PostgreSQL or GraphQL) and Backend (Typescript, Express) hosting
        - Smart contract library (Solidity + OpenZeppelin)
        - Blockchain testnet
        - Sample cooperative structures for simulation

        ## Support Provided by Monark or Partner

        Monark will support the project with expertise in blockchain and smart contract development. The current team will assist with onboarding and knowledge transfer. A dedicated Discord server will be used for communication, and bi-monthly Sprint-style meetings with the CTO and/or COO will coordinate project progress. The CTO will also provide UI/UX guidance. Extensive documentation will be available to help students learn the blockchain technology and deliver a functional project.
