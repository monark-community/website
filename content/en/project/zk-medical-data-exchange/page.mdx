# Zero-Knowledge Medical Data Exchange

A decentralized protocol enabling patients to share anonymized medical data with researchers using zero-knowledge proofs, preserving privacy while supporting scientific progress.

## General Description

Cura addresses a central challenge in digital health: how to access sensitive health data without compromising privacy. Currently, valuable medical data is siloed due to ethical, legal, and trust-related constraintsâ€”yet this same data is essential for clinical research and AI development.

Cura proposes a privacy-first, decentralized exchange where users:
- Prove ownership and consent via cryptographic proofs.
- Are compensated or recognized for data contributions.
- Enable researchers to access anonymized, criteria-matched datasets without exposing raw data.

By combining zero-knowledge proofs with open blockchain infrastructure, Cura builds a trustless, ethical medical data marketplace governed by users. This promotes data sovereignty, discourages monopolies, and supports regulatory compliance.

The system is modular and interoperable, allowing integration by hospitals and research institutions without vendor lock-in. Smart contracts manage dynamic consent, while mechanisms for revocation and permission updates ensure long-term trust and compliance (e.g. HIPAA, GDPR).

## Deliverables & Desired Functionnalities

- **ZK-Proof Engine for Data Ownership & Eligibility**
   - Users submit cryptographic proofs showing they meet research criteria (e.g. age group, condition, location) without revealing raw data.
   - Supports data types like EHRs, wearables, genomics.
- **Researcher Portal & Matching Engine**
   - Researchers create encrypted data requests with eligibility filters.
   - Platform performs ZK-based matching and aggregates anonymized stats.
- **Consent & Reward System**
   - DAO-based system for users to grant/revoke consent for use cases.
   - Smart contracts automatically handle micro-payments or donations.
- **Metadata Indexing**
   - Public, queryable indexes for:
      - Aggregated health data by category
      - Active research projects
      - DAO decisions and funding flows
- **Data Vault + Encrypted Off-Chain Storage**
   - User-controlled vaults store encrypted medical data (e.g., via IPFS).
   - Only ZK commitments live on-chain, preserving privacy.
- **Governance & Audit Layer**
   - Transparent DAO for protocol updates, ethics reviews and dispute resolution.
   - Indexed logs for governance, user participation and usage transparency.

## Required Ressources

- **Web Hosting Platform**
   - e.g., Vercel or Netlify for deploying the frontend (React/Next.js).
- **Blockchain Testnet Environment**
   - To deploy and test smart contracts (e.g., Ethereum Sepolia).
- **Smart Contract Framework**
   - Solidity with OpenZeppelin libraries for secure contract development.
- **ZK Network**
   - For confidential smart contracts, private logic execution and ZK identity proofs.
- **Backend Hosting Servers**
   - For managing APIs, user authentication and ZK circuit interactions (e.g., Node.js or Rust-based backend).
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof System**
   - SNARKs, STARKs, Semaphore, or other ZK primitives to handle privacy-preserving proofs.
- **Encrypted Off-Chain Storage Layer**
   - e.g., IPFS with Lit Protocol or Filecoin for encrypted data storage and controlled access.
- **Optional (Recommended for Testing / Simulation)**
   - Realistic sample medical datasets (synthetic or de-identified).
      - Test users for UI/UX flows and proof generation.
      - IRB / Ethics consultants if simulating real-world deployments or designing for clinical settings.
