# Multichain Portfolio Tracker

Build a dashboard that aggregates a user's holdings across multiple blockchains. Show token balances, NFTs, and historical activity using APIs or RPCs the supported blockchains. Add filtering, wallet tagging, asset valuation, and graphs. This helps users view their Web3 footprint in one place.

## General Description

[MultiTrack](https://multitrack.monark.io) is a blockchain analytics tool designed to simplify asset tracking across multiple chains in a single interface. As crypto adoption grows, users increasingly manage tokens, NFTs, and DeFi positions on multiple blockchains. This project builds a unified portfolio view for these users by connecting to public APIs or node endpoints across test networks to retrieve data such as wallet balances, asset types, transaction histories, and token values.

MultiTrack aggregates and normalizes this data, presenting it in a clean, interactive dashboard. It may include visual summaries (pie charts, performance graphs), per-chain asset breakdowns, and optional tagging (e.g., long-term vs. short-term holdings). Students may implement caching or pagination for scalability, as well as filtering and sorting mechanisms for high usability.

Advanced features could include daily performance tracking, exporting data for taxes, or even light wallet management like transaction simulation or gas estimation. Although commercial versions exist, this student project emphasizes open design, transparency, and extensibility. It allows teams to learn how to interface with real-time blockchain data, transform JSON-based results into user-friendly formats, and design modular analytics infrastructure. It is ideal for students interested in both UX and back-end engineering in crypto.
