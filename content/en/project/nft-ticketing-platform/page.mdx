title: NFT Ticketing Platform
description: A full-stack NFT ticketing platform where organizers mint unique event tickets as NFTs. Tickets include metadata (seat, time, access rules, special rewards, etc.), and can be scanned for entry via blockchain wallet signature or QR code. Resale restrictions and secondary royalties are enforced via smart contracts. You can add bonus features like POAP collectibles, attendance badges, or discount perks.

## General Description

[NFTokenPass](https://nftokenpass.monark.io) transforms event ticketing by minting blockchain-based NFTs that act as unique, verifiable access credentials. Event organizers use a frontend to create NFT tickets with metadata like event time, seat location, and price. Once purchased, the NFT is stored in the buyer's wallet and scanned at entry via QR code or signature verification.

Smart contracts enforce resale rules (e.g., royalties, price limits), reducing fraud and scalping. This solution empowers artists and venues to retain control over secondary sales while also rewarding fans. Bonus features include dynamic content (changing visuals based on event stages) and souvenir NFTs for attendees.

It also offers long-term utility: NFT ticketing can be extended to subscriptions, conferences, festivals, or Web3 metaverse access. Students working on this project will get deep exposure to NFTs, decentralized marketplaces, and ticket validation flows.

## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

- Web interface using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    - Create a modern, responsive web platform where users can view, buy and manage NFT tickets.
- User authentication
    - Enable wallet-based registration and login using [MetaMask embedded-wallets](https://metamask.io/en-GB/developer/embedded-wallets)
    - Enable secure login using wallet-based authentication so both organizers and attendees can safely manage tickets and events.
- NFT minting dashboard for event organizers
    - Build a dashboard for event organizers to mint NFT tickets with metadata like seat number, event time, and pricing conditions.
- Ticket verification system via QR/wallet signature
    - Develop a secure check-in system using QR code scanning or wallet signature to validate tickets on-site or online.
- Resale restrictions, royalties, and whitelist logic
    - Use smart contracts to control ticket resales by enforcing price limits, royalties, or whitelists to prevent scalping and reward creators.
- Optional POAP-style commemorative NFTs
    - Add extra features like POAPs (Proof of Attendance NFTs), badges, or discount tokens to reward attendees and create collectible value.
