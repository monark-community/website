# Bounty System

Develop a decentralized platform for task bounties. Users post tasks with deadlines and rewards, contributors submit work, and admins or voters validate the result before payout. Useful for open-source projects, student challenges, or DAO task distribution. Includes smart contract logic and a dashboard for browsing, submitting, and tracking.

## General Description

[TaskFlow](https://taskflow.monark.io) is a trustless bounty management platform for DAOs, open-source projects, and Web3 communities. It enables organizations to publish tasks or challenges, attach token-based rewards, and review submissions. Once a submission is approved, the associated smart contract automatically disburses the funds to the contributor's wallet.
        
The system supports task categories, submission deadlines, approval flows, and rejection notes. It also includes a contributor leaderboard, reputation scores, and optional role-based task visibility.
        
TaskFlow offers clear benefits over traditional platforms: no central party controls the payout, contributors are rewarded transparently, and tasks are immutable and verifiable. This reduces disputes, simplifies contributor onboarding, and builds momentum in community-led development.
        
Students will explore smart contract security, reward logic, role assignment, and UX design for incentive-driven workflows. They'll also learn to simulate DAO workflows such as multi-sig approvals or validator rotation.

## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

- Web interface using Next.js, Typescript, shadcn-ui, tailwindcss
- User authentication 
- Smart contract to create, manage, and resolve bounties
- Submission portal with file upload support
- Approval dashboard with payout trigger
- Contributor profile and history viewer
- (Optional) Points system for gamification

## Required Resources

- Web hosting platform (Vercel)
- Database (Clickhouse, PostgreSQL or GraphQL) and Backend (Typescript, Express) hosting
- Smart contract library (Solidity + OpenZeppelin)
- Blockchain testnet
- Frontend wallet-connected interface
- Mock DAO or org to simulate users
- Testnet token for bounties

## Support Provided by Monark or Partner

Monark will support the project with expertise in blockchain and smart contract development. The current team will assist with onboarding and knowledge transfer. A dedicated Discord server will be used for communication, and bi-monthly Sprint-style meetings with the CTO and/or COO will coordinate project progress. The CTO will also provide UI/UX guidance. Extensive documentation will be available to help students learn the blockchain technology and deliver a functional project.
