## Real Use Cases: Where Blockchain Excels

### 1. Smart Contracts: Automating Trust

Smart contracts excel when:

- Multiple parties need to transact without complete trust
- Conditions for execution are programmable and verifiable on-chain
- Transparency of contract terms benefits all participants

However, they struggle with:

- Complex legal terms that require interpretation
- Scenarios requiring real-world data input (the "oracle problem")
- Immutability that prevents bug fixes or adjustments

### 2. Transparency & Immutability: Building Trust

Blockchain shines for:

- Supply chain tracking where multiple parties need verified information
- Public records that benefit from tamper-proof storage
- Financial systems where audit trails are crucial

But falls short when:

- Privacy is paramount (despite advancements in zero-knowledge proofs)
- Data volume is high and throughput requirements exceed current capabilities
- Compliance requires the ability to modify or delete records

### 3. Digital Ownership & Provenance

Effective applications include:

- Tokenized real-world assets with clear legal frameworks
- Digital art and collectibles where provenance matters
- Cross-border transactions where traditional systems create friction

Less effective for:

- Assets without clear legal recognition of on-chain ownership
- Scenarios where transaction speed is critical
- Use cases where cost of transaction exceeds value added

## The Hard Truth: When NOT to Use Blockchain

Despite our position in the Web3 space, we must acknowledge blockchain is often unnecessary when:

- A centralized database would suffice (and be faster, cheaper, and more efficient)
- Trust already exists between parties
- The problem doesn't require decentralization, immutability, or trustlessness
- Users won't tolerate the UX friction current blockchain solutions impose
- Regulatory compliance requires centralized control or the ability to reverse transactions

## Persistent Challenges

Several foundational challenges continue to limit adoption:

- **User Experience:** Wallet management, transaction fees, and confirmation times remain significant barriers to mainstream use
- **Scalability:** Despite Layer 2 solutions, throughput limitations persist
- **Energy Consumption:** While Proof of Stake has improved efficiency, total network impacts remain concerning
- **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Inconsistent global regulatory approaches create significant business risk
- **Technical Complexity:** The learning curve for developers and users remains steep

## The Monark Approach

At Monark, our university-corporate collaboration focuses on pragmatic applications:

- We rigorously evaluate use cases before recommending blockchain solutions
- We prioritize projects where blockchain provides unique, measurable advantages
- We approach technical challenges honestly, avoiding empty promises
- We align innovation with regulatory considerations from day one

By acknowledging both strengths and limitations, we build sustainable blockchain solutions that deliver genuine value rather than simply chasing technological trends.

## Conclusion

Blockchain technology offers transformative potential in specific domains, but it's not a universal solution. The most successful implementations will come from clear-eyed assessment of where its unique properties—decentralization, immutability, and trustlessness—truly add value that outweighs the associated costs and complications.

At Monark, we're committed to this balanced approach, ensuring our incubated projects build on blockchain's strengths while recognizing its limitations.
