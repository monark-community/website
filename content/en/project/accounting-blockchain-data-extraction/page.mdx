# Accounting blockchain data extraction

A tool that extracts, cleans, and formats blockchain transaction data into accounting-ready formats. Users can input a wallet address and receive categorized income/expenses, gas fees, and timestamps. Useful for DAOs, freelancers, and businesses needing audit trails or tax reports. You can use [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/), APIs, or indexers to feed the data.

## General Description

[LedgerLift](https://ledgerlift.monark.io) is a back-end focused blockchain analytics project aimed at financial reporting and audit-readiness for individuals, DAOs, and crypto businesses. The goal is to extract transaction history, gas fees, token swaps, income streams, and wallet activity, then convert that data into human-readable formats for accounting, compliance, or treasury reporting.

The platform connects to user-provided wallets, fetches transaction data using public APIs or subgraph queries, and classifies the entries (e.g., expense, income, transfer). Students may add features like automatic tagging, wallet labeling, or multi-wallet aggregation. Output formats include CSV files, financial summaries, or integration-ready data for accounting tools like QuickBooks or Excel.

This project provides strong exposure to data normalization, metadata parsing, and classification heuristics. Bonus features can include token price fetching at transaction time, gas cost aggregation, or tax-lot estimation. By working on LedgerLift, students learn to bridge the technical gap between blockchain data and off-chain financial processes.

The system helps solve one of the most urgent needs for Web3 teams and freelancers: making blockchain-native finance legible and legally usable in a world of traditional regulation.
