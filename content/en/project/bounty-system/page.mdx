# Bounty System

A decentralized platform for task bounties. Users post tasks with deadlines and rewards, contributors submit work, and admins or voters validate the result before payout. Useful for open-source projects, student challenges, or DAO task distribution. Includes smart contract logic and a dashboard for browsing, submitting, and tracking.

## General Description

[TaskFlow](https://taskflow.monark.io) is a trustless bounty management platform for DAOs, open-source projects, and Web3 communities. It enables organizations to publish tasks or challenges, attach token-based rewards, and review submissions. Once a submission is approved, the associated smart contract automatically disburses the funds to the contributor's wallet.
        
The system supports task categories, submission deadlines, approval flows, and rejection notes. It also includes a contributor leaderboard, reputation scores, and optional role-based task visibility.
        
TaskFlow offers clear benefits over traditional platforms: no central party controls the payout, contributors are rewarded transparently, and tasks are immutable and verifiable. This reduces disputes, simplifies contributor onboarding, and builds momentum in community-led development.
        
Students will explore smart contract security, reward logic, role assignment, and UX design for incentive-driven workflows. They'll also learn to simulate DAO workflows such as multi-sig approvals or validator rotation.

## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

- Web interface using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
   - Build a modern platform for submitting and browsing bounties.
- User authentication 
   - Let users log in with their wallet to post, claim, or validate tasks.
- Smart contract to create, manage, and resolve bounties
   - Post tasks with rewards and deadlines; funds are locked and paid out on approval.
- Submission & approval dashboard
   - Contributors upload work, validators review and trigger smart contract payouts.
- Contributor profile and history viewer
   - Track user activity, reputation, and task completion history.
- (Optional) Points system for gamification
