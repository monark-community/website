# DAO Voting Platform

A decentralized governance platform that enables token- or wallet-based voting on proposals. Users can submit ideas, cast votes, and track results. Features include quorum logic, delegation, live results, and optional execution hooks. Ideal for DAOs, student orgs, or cooperatives. This is a foundational block for on-chain decision-making.

## General Description

[GovChain](https://govchain.monark.io) is a fully decentralized governance system that enables communities, DAOs, and organizations to create proposals, hold votes, and implement decisionsâ€”all without relying on a central authority. The system allows users to submit proposals directly from their wallets, define voting periods and quorum thresholds, and track results through a transparent, tamper-proof interface.

Whether applied to a decentralized student council, a community protocol, or a collective art group, GovChain ensures that every member has a voice and that the entire decision-making process is auditable and fair. Voting power can be distributed evenly (one wallet = one vote), weighted by token holdings, or delegated to trusted representatives. The system is flexible enough to simulate real-world structures like boards, committees, or shareholder voting.

One of the most powerful aspects of GovChain is its ability to serve as a testbed for new governance models. Participants can simulate proposal lifecycles, measure participation rates, and adapt their rules over time. Students will learn about governance design and on-chain vs off-chain vote recording. They will also explore frontend development to make governance tools user-friendly and transparent. This project offers hands-on experience in smart contract security, incentive alignment, and governance theory.

## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

- Web interface using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
   - Build a governance hub where members can propose, vote, and view results.
- User authentication 
   - Allow wallet-based login to track voter roles and proposal interaction.
- Web UI for proposal submission and tracking
   - Submit, edit, and monitor proposal progress with status indicators.
- Token- or wallet-based voting logic with real-time tallying
   - Let users vote using wallet identity or token-based voting power.
- Role-based permissions (e.g., proposal creator, admin, voter)
   - Assign admin, voter, or proposer roles with on-chain enforcement.
- Voting status (Pending, Active, Executed) with result history
   - Track each proposal's lifecycle: Pending, Active, Executed, or Rejected.
- Quorum and voting threshold rules settable per proposal
   - Let proposers define voting conditions like min voters or pass rate.
