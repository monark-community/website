        ## General Description

        BorrowX focuses specifically on the borrowing experience within a decentralized lending protocol. Users can view available assets, deposit collateral, select borrowing terms, and initiate loans. The system tracks the user's collateral ratio, repayment schedule, and borrowing interest.
        
        The smart contract ensures safety by locking collateral, updating health metrics, and triggering liquidation if the value of collateral drops too far. BorrowX can either operate standalone or connect to a liquidity pool like VaultLend. This modular focus allows students to specialize in user-facing lending mechanics without building a full lending platform.
        
        The frontend includes loan sliders, visual collateral dashboards, repayment tracking, and liquidation alerts. Bonus features include flexible interest rate models (fixed/variable), partial repayments, or credit score simulations.
        
        Students gain experience with financial modeling, precision math, time-based state changes, and wallet-based loan management. BorrowX provides a deep dive into a key piece of the Web3 financial puzzle, delivering strong engineering and UX skills.
