# Guardian

Guardian is a mobile Web3 alert app that notifies nearby users in emergencies. Alerts are tied to wallet IDs, and responders receive funds from a pre-funded smart contract pool. This incentivizes real help while discouraging misuse through built-in accountability and rewards.

## General Description

[Guardian](https://guardian.monark.io) is a mobile-first decentralized application designed to empower citizens during emergencies by leveraging proximity-based alerts and financial incentives. Users who feel unsafe or face an urgent situation can trigger an on-chain alert that is broadcast to other users within a predefined geographic radius. Those who respond to the alert—ideally in-person or via verified assistance—can receive compensation from a smart contract pool pre-funded by the original user.

This incentive system is critical: it discourages misuse by ensuring that alerts cost the sender a small, pre-approved amount, while rewarding helpful intervention and encouraging the growth of a trust-based responder network. Each response is logged on-chain, tied to the responder's wallet, with reputation data accumulated over time. Repeat responders may earn higher reputation scores and access to additional tasks or emergency tiers.

The system includes GPS integration, a verification flow (e.g., confirm alert legitimacy or assistance rendered), and a simple UI for triggering, managing, and responding to alerts. This solution merges civic tech, microtransactions, and decentralized reputation systems to create a real-world safety tool—especially useful in areas with high foot traffic, university campuses, or local communities.

Students working on Guardian will explore decentralized identity, location-aware services, reputation tracking, and time-sensitive payment logic, while also building intuitive mobile interfaces.

## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

- Web interface using Next.js, Typescript, shadcn-ui, tailwindcss
    - Launch a GPS-integrated alert system for community use.
- User authentication 
    - Connect wallet to send or respond to emergency alerts.
- Mobile-optimized frontend with emergency trigger button and responder map
    - Send an alert to nearby users in one click.
- Smart contracts for managing alert radius, responder payments, and verification
    - Store funds and distribute rewards to verified responders.
- On-chain record of events and reputation tracking
    - Track helpful responders and build trust scores.
- Admin interface to adjust payment pools and radius thresholds
    - Adjust radius or payment settings for specific groups.
- (Optional) integration with trusted contact list or DAO-based responder groups

## Required Resources

- Web hosting platform (Vercel)
- Database (Clickhouse, PostgreSQL or GraphQL) and Backend (Typescript, Express) hosting
- Smart contract library (Solidity + OpenZeppelin)
