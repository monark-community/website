# Smart Contracts Explained Like You're 5

<aside>
ðŸ’¡
In a world increasingly dominated by blockchain technology and decentralized applications, smart contracts have emerged as one of the most transformative innovations. Yet despite their growing importance, there remains significant confusion about what they actually are and how they function. This article aims to demystify smart contracts with straightforward explanations while addressing their real limitations and potential.

</aside>

## What are Smart Contracts?

At their core, smart contracts are simply automated agreements that execute predefined actions when specific conditions are met. Think of them as digital vending machines: you insert a coin, make a selection, and automatically receive your item without needing a human operator.

More technically, smart contracts are self-executing code deployed on blockchain networks like Ethereum. Once deployed, they operate independently according to their programming, removing the need for intermediaries and creating trustless interactions between parties.

> Smart contracts are neither particularly "smart" nor legal "contracts" in the traditional sense. They're deterministic programs that automatically execute when triggered by specific blockchain transactions.


## Examples in the Wild

### Uniswap: Algorithmic Market Making

Uniswap exemplifies smart contracts at scale. This decentralized exchange operates entirely through smart contracts that maintain liquidity pools and facilitate token swaps without order books or centralized parties. Users interact directly with these contracts, which mathematically determine exchange rates based on pool ratios.

The brutal truth: While revolutionary, Uniswap's smart contracts have limitations including impermanent loss for liquidity providers, high gas fees during network congestion, and vulnerability to certain exploits despite multiple security audits.

### NFTs: Digital Ownership Enforcement

Non-fungible tokens represent another prominent application of smart contracts. These contracts establish verifiable scarcity and ownership of digital assets on the blockchain, enabling artists and creators to monetize digital work in unprecedented ways.

Reality check: The NFT market has been plagued by wash trading, copyright infringement, and environmental concerns. Many NFT smart contracts ([See Smilesssvrs, Boss Beauties, MekaApes](https://pinata.cloud/blog/hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-of-nfts-are-still-unprotected/)) also fail to properly store the actual digital assets on-chain, instead pointing to centralized servers that could potentially disappear.

### DAOs: Decentralized Governance

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations use smart contracts to coordinate collective decision-making and resource allocation. Voting rights are typically distributed through governance tokens, with execution happening automatically when proposals meet predetermined thresholds.

Hard truth: Many DAOs struggle with low participation rates, plutocratic control by large token holders, and legal ambiguity. The infamous "[The DAO](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/understanding-the-dao-attack)" hack of 2016 led to Ethereum's contentious hard fork, highlighting the risks of immutable yet flawed code.

## Replacing Traditional Logic

### Institutional Disintermediation

Smart contracts can replace functions traditionally performed by trusted institutions. Escrow services, insurance claim processing, supply chain verification, and even aspects of lending can be automated through blockchain-based agreements, potentially reducing costs and eliminating gatekeepers.

However, this disintermediation comes with tradeoffs. Smart contracts operate with binary logic in environments where nuance is often required. They can't easily adapt to exceptional circumstances without human intervention, which undermines their autonomous nature.

### Software Revolution

In software development, smart contracts represent a shift from centralized to decentralized application architecture. Traditional software runs on servers controlled by specific entities, whereas dApps distribute both processing and governance across blockchain networks.

The inconvenient reality: This distribution creates significant challenges in scalability, user experience, and upgradeability. Smart contracts are notoriously difficult to update once deployed, creating potential security risks when vulnerabilities are discovered.

## The Uncomfortable Truths

### Technical Limitations

- Smart contracts remain expensive to deploy and interact with on most Layer 1 blockchains
- They're constrained by the limitations of their underlying blockchains (throughput, latency)
- The "oracle problem" creates challenges in reliably connecting smart contracts to real-world data
- Code vulnerabilities have led to billions in lost funds across DeFi protocols

### Practical Challenges

- Most users struggle to verify smart contract code, creating a paradoxical reliance on trust in a "trustless" system
- Legal enforceability varies dramatically across jurisdictions
- Smart contract immutability, while a feature, becomes problematic when upgrades are necessary
- Developer experience remains challenging compared to traditional software development

## Conclusion: The Path Forward

Smart contracts represent a profound innovation with the potential to reshape digital interactions, but they're not a panacea. At Monark, we recognize both their transformative potential and their current limitations. Our approach focuses on identifying specific use cases where smart contracts provide clear advantages over traditional systems, rather than applying blockchain technology indiscriminately.

The most successful smart contract implementations will likely be those that complement existing systems rather than attempting to replace them wholesale. By combining the automation and trustlessness of smart contracts with the flexibility and adaptability of traditional software and legal frameworks, we can harness their benefits while mitigating their drawbacks.

As we continue developing our web3 incubator programs and university collaborations, we maintain a commitment to both innovation and pragmatism. The future of smart contracts isn't just about technological possibility; it's about creating practical value in a complex world that rarely fits neatly into deterministic code.
