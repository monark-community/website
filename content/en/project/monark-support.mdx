## Support Provided by Monark or Partner

Monark will support the project with expertise in blockchain and smart contract development. The current team will assist with onboarding and knowledge transfer. A dedicated Discord server will be used for communication, and bi-monthly Sprint-style meetings with the CTO and/or COO will coordinate project progress. The CTO will also provide UI/UX guidance, project starters and relevant Monark tooling.

Extensive documentation will be available to help students learn the blockchain technology and deliver a functional project. In addition, Monark will provide Monark-funded wallets for on-chain operations, along with starter frontend and backend templates and wallet integration to accelerate development and lower technical barriers.
