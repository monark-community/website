## General Description

[Guardian](https://guardian.monark.io) is a mobile-first decentralized application designed to empower citizens during emergencies by leveraging proximity-based alerts and financial incentives. Users who feel unsafe or face an urgent situation can trigger an on-chain alert that is broadcast to other users within a predefined geographic radius. Those who respond to the alert—ideally in-person or via verified assistance—can receive compensation from a smart contract pool pre-funded by the original user.

This incentive system is critical: it discourages misuse by ensuring that alerts cost the sender a small, pre-approved amount, while rewarding helpful intervention and encouraging the growth of a trust-based responder network. Each response is logged on-chain, tied to the responder's wallet, with reputation data accumulated over time. Repeat responders may earn higher reputation scores and access to additional tasks or emergency tiers.

The system includes GPS integration, a verification flow (e.g., confirm alert legitimacy or assistance rendered), and a simple UI for triggering, managing, and responding to alerts. This solution merges civic tech, microtransactions, and decentralized reputation systems to create a real-world safety tool—especially useful in areas with high foot traffic, university campuses, or local communities.

Students working on Guardian will explore decentralized identity, location-aware services, reputation tracking, and time-sensitive payment logic, while also building intuitive mobile interfaces.
