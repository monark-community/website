        ## General Description

        LedgerLift is a back-end focused blockchain analytics project aimed at financial reporting and audit-readiness for individuals, DAOs, and crypto businesses. The goal is to extract transaction history, gas fees, token swaps, income streams, and wallet activity, then convert that data into human-readable formats for accounting, compliance, or treasury reporting.

        The platform connects to user-provided wallets, fetches transaction data using public APIs or subgraph queries, and classifies the entries (e.g., expense, income, transfer). Students may add features like automatic tagging, wallet labeling, or multi-wallet aggregation. Output formats include CSV files, financial summaries, or integration-ready data for accounting tools like QuickBooks or Excel.

        This project provides strong exposure to data normalization, metadata parsing, and classification heuristics. Bonus features can include token price fetching at transaction time, gas cost aggregation, or tax-lot estimation. By working on LedgerLift, students learn to bridge the technical gap between blockchain data and off-chain financial processes.

        The system helps solve one of the most urgent needs for Web3 teams and freelancers: making blockchain-native finance legible and legally usable in a world of traditional regulation.

        ## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

        - Transaction fetcher for standard wallet activity
        - Normalization logic to classify transfers, swaps, and gas usage
        - Data export system (CSV, JSON) with labeled fields
        - Summary stats: total income, spend, fees, PnL
        - (Optional) Token price lookup and tax report generator

        ## Required Resources

        - Public blockchain indexer or explorer API
        - Backend logic in Python, JS, or TypeScript
        - Frontend dashboard (optional)
        - Wallet address samples for simulation

        ## Support Provided by Monark or Partner

        Monark will support the project with expertise in blockchain and smart contract development. The current team will assist with onboarding and knowledge transfer. A dedicated Discord server will be used for communication, and bi-monthly Sprint-style meetings with the CTO and/or COO will coordinate project progress. The CTO will also provide UI/UX guidance. Extensive documentation will be available to help students learn the blockchain technology and deliver a functional project.
