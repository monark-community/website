# ðŸš€ Incubation program

Got a great idea but not sure how to take it further? Need funding but not quite ready for support from a major foundation like the Web3 Foundation? This is the perfect next step for you and your team.

We support developers and early-stage teams in developing their ideas into functional, fundable applications. With expert mentorship, the right tools, and strategic guidance, we'll help you reach the level where your project is ready to apply for grants from leading Web3 foundations.

Here's what we offer at **no upfront cost** if you join our incubation program:

- **4-12 month support cycles** designed to take you from idea to product
- **Sprint-based mentorship** with follow-ups, goal setting, and strategic reviews
- **Administrative and legal templates** (incorporation, NDAs, contributor agreements, etc.)
- **Technical guidance** and access to Monark's internal developer tools
- **Workshops on Web3 topics** like tokenomics, governance, and product design
- **Preparation for funding rounds** from major Web3 ecosystems and foundations
- **Keep full ownership** of your project, we're here to support, not control
