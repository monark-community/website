description: Aprotocol where users supply tokens to liquidity pools in exchange for interest. Manage pool size, utilization rate, and reward logic. Visualize returns over time and integrate with borrow contracts if desired. An excellent way to teach lending mechanics, risk pooling, and token incentives.

## General Description

[Yieldmine](https://yieldmine.monark.io) is a decentralized lending system where users contribute tokens to a pooled vault and earn yield over time. The system mimics protocols like Compound and Yearn Finance by distributing returns to lenders based on interest earned from borrowers.

Students will implement smart contracts to handle lending deposits, interest rate models (e.g., utilization-based), and withdrawal rights. Contracts must track lender shares, ensure accurate interest calculation, and support liquidity rebalancing. The project teaches risk/reward mechanics, time-based state changes, and fund tracking.

The frontend includes deposit interfaces, APY displays, live interest calculators, and withdrawal queues. Users can view their earning history and active positions in a clear, visual format. Optionally, students can simulate governance mechanics for protocol parameters like reserve rates or maximum LTV.

YieldMine offers strong exposure to passive income tools, liquidity design, token economics, and sustainable financial modeling in decentralized environments.
