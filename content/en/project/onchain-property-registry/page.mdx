# Cadastrum

A decentralized land and building registry where users can submit and update the physical location, construction year, and modifications of buildings on land parcels. This enables transparent, time-stamped tracking of structures and helps identify regulatory compliance or violations over time.

## General Description

[Cadastrum](https://cadastrum.monark.io) is a civic infrastructure project that leverages blockchain to store and maintain a public registry of land and building data. Users can submit updates to parcel-level information such as construction year, structural modifications, zoning details, and other compliance-relevant attributes. Each update is tied to a wallet address, timestamped, and stored immutably on-chain, creating a clear audit trail for inspectors, municipalities, and property owners.
        
This registry addresses current challenges in outdated, inaccessible, or fragmented land records. It allows communities to collaboratively track development activity, verify structural changes, and flag irregularities. Through a map-based interface, users can view the history and current status of any lot, submit new updates, and (optionally) attach documentation or media files via IPFS.
        
Advanced features may include role-based submissions (e.g., homeowner vs. city official), voting or validation for changes, and cross-integration with zoning or land use proposals. Students will build on-chain storage systems, map overlays, and frontend tools for contributing and browsing property data. This project is ideal for those interested in civic tech, smart cities, and decentralized public services.

## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

- Web interface using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
    - Display property records on an interactive, public map.
- User authentication 
    - Log in with wallet to submit, review, or edit parcel data.
- Smart contracts to store and update parcel/building records
    - Add timestamped updates for construction, zoning, etc.
- Map-based UI for interacting with property data
    - Browse and contribute data on parcels via OpenStreetMap.
- History log of changes and submissions per parcel
    - View the full change log for any parcel.
- Role system to categorize contributors
- (Optional) integration with land-use voting systems
    - Separate data submissions by role (citizen, official).
