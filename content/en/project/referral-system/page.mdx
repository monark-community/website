title: Referral System
description: A referral engine that tracks wallet-to-wallet invitations and rewards activity-based outcomes (e.g., app sign-ups, task completions). Smart contracts store who referred whom, trigger rewards when milestones are hit, and prevent abuse. Perfect for ambassador programs or affiliate networks. Includes dashboards for tracking performance.

## General Description

[Reffinity](https://reffinity.monark.io) is a smart contract-powered referral system designed to bring transparency and automation to user onboarding and growth incentives. The system enables users (e.g., ambassadors, promoters, or early adopters) to invite others to a platform or dApp. When referred users take predefined actions—such as joining, purchasing, or completing a milestone—the referring wallet receives a reward.

Each referral relationship is recorded immutably via smart contracts, making it tamper-proof and publicly auditable. Students will implement wallet tracking logic, handle loops or abuse cases (e.g., self-referral prevention), and build a simple frontend to allow users to generate and share referral links.

Use cases include token airdrops, community campaigns, protocol usage incentives, and ambassador programs. Students will also gain experience in incentive design, gamification, and basic analytics (e.g., top referrers, click-through rates).

Reffinity adds lasting value in Web3 growth infrastructure, replacing opaque affiliate systems with decentralized mechanics.
