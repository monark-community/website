Monark's expertise has been forged through the resounding success of a collaborative project between the University of Sherbrooke, EOS Nation, and Vincent Grenier himself. This project, which resulted in the design of a revolutionary decentralized accounting system, <a href="https://www.usherbrooke.ca/actualites/nouvelles/sciences-innovations-technologiques/details/42749" target="_blank">CryptoSys</a>, perfectly illustrates Monark's ability to bridge the gap between academia and industry.

"We observed how students, when guided by industry professionals, can develop innovative solutions that address real market needs."

## A Unique Support Methodology

Monark's strength lies in its tailored support methodology for university projects. The company doesn't simply act as a financial partner, but as a true technical and strategic mentor that guides students through each step of the development process. This approach ensures concrete results that are applicable in real-world contexts.

## A Growing Innovation Ecosystem

Thanks to its extensive network of industrial and academic partners, Monark is able to create a true innovation ecosystem around decentralized technologies. This environment allows students to benefit from maximum industry exposure while maintaining the academic framework necessary for their training.

## Concrete Impact on Education

The benefits of partnerships initiated by Monark extend far beyond the scope of the projects themselves. Students involved develop sought-after professional skills and a network that will facilitate their integration into the industry.
