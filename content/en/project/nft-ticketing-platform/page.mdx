# NFT Ticketing Platform

Build a full-stack NFT ticketing platform where organizers mint unique event tickets as NFTs. Tickets include metadata (seat, time, access rules, special rewards, etc.), and can be scanned for entry via blockchain wallet signature or QR code. Resale restrictions and secondary royalties are enforced via smart contracts. You can add bonus features like POAP collectibles, attendance badges, or discount perks.

## General Description

[NFTokenPass](https://nftokenpass.monark.io) transforms event ticketing by minting blockchain-based NFTs that act as unique, verifiable access credentials. Event organizers use a frontend to create NFT tickets with metadata like event time, seat location, and price. Once purchased, the NFT is stored in the buyer's wallet and scanned at entry via QR code or signature verification.

Smart contracts enforce resale rules (e.g., royalties, price limits), reducing fraud and scalping. This solution empowers artists and venues to retain control over secondary sales while also rewarding fans. Bonus features include dynamic content (changing visuals based on event stages) and souvenir NFTs for attendees.

It also offers long-term utility: NFT ticketing can be extended to subscriptions, conferences, festivals, or Web3 metaverse access. Students working on this project will get deep exposure to NFTs, decentralized marketplaces, and ticket validation flows.
