        ## General Description

        GovChain is a fully decentralized governance system that enables communities, DAOs, and organizations to create proposals, hold votes, and implement decisionsâ€”all without relying on a central authority. The system allows users to submit proposals directly from their wallets, define voting periods and quorum thresholds, and track results through a transparent, tamper-proof interface.
        
        Whether applied to a decentralized student council, a community protocol, or a collective art group, GovChain ensures that every member has a voice and that the entire decision-making process is auditable and fair. Voting power can be distributed evenly (one wallet = one vote), weighted by token holdings, or delegated to trusted representatives. The system is flexible enough to simulate real-world structures like boards, committees, or shareholder voting.
        
        One of the most powerful aspects of GovChain is its ability to serve as a testbed for new governance models. Participants can simulate proposal lifecycles, measure participation rates, and adapt their rules over time. Students will learn about governance design and on-chain vs off-chain vote recording. They will also explore frontend development to make governance tools user-friendly and transparent. This project offers hands-on experience in smart contract security, incentive alignment, and governance theory.

        ## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

        - Web interface using Next.js, Typescript, shadcn-ui, tailwindcss
        - User authentication 
        - Web UI for proposal submission and tracking
        - Token- or wallet-based voting logic with real-time tallying
        - Role-based permissions (e.g., proposal creator, admin, voter)
        - Voting status (Pending, Active, Executed) with result history
        - Quorum and voting threshold rules settable per proposal

        ## Required Resources

        - Web hosting platform (Vercel)
        - Database (Clickhouse, PostgreSQL or GraphQL) and Backend (Typescript, Express) hosting
        - Smart contract library (Solidity + OpenZeppelin)
        - Blockchain testnet
        - Web3 integration libraries (e.g., wagmi, ethers.js)
        - Token minting tools or faucet access for mock governance tokens
        - GitHub for version control and public proposals

        ## Support Provided by Monark or Partner

        Monark will support the project with expertise in blockchain and smart contract development. The current team will assist with onboarding and knowledge transfer. A dedicated Discord server will be used for communication, and bi-monthly Sprint-style meetings with the CTO and/or COO will coordinate project progress. The CTO will also provide UI/UX guidance. Extensive documentation will be available to help students learn the blockchain technology and deliver a functional project.
