# Systems for Co-ops

A modular system for digital cooperatives with a big focus on accessibility and ease of use. Members join via wallet, vote on proposals, and manage shared resources and finances. Include a treasury dashboard, proposal history, and access roles. Designed for groups that want to operate transparently and democratically without centralized software. Could simulate DAO-like operations with real-world use cases.

## General Description

[CoopDAO](https://coopdao.monark.io) is a decentralized operating system for cooperatives, designed to help small groups, associations, or communities organize transparently without traditional bureaucratic overhead. In its core implementation, the project will enable wallet-based membership registration, proposal submission, voting, and shared treasury management. These features allow cooperatives to operate like digital DAOs while still serving real-world usersâ€”whether farmers, local collectives, mutual aid networks, or student-led initiatives.

The platform allows members to submit proposals (e.g., budget allocation, new hires, project launches), vote based on agreed-upon rules, and execute treasury transactions in a secure and auditable way. Smart contracts manage roles, permissions, and proposal logic, while the frontend UI ensures accessibility and inclusivity across digital literacy levels.

An important component of CoopDAO is the integration of reputation or trust metrics to reward consistent, meaningful participation. Students may explore tokenized membership, role-based voting weights, and rotating committee roles. On the treasury side, expenses can be proposed, peer-reviewed, and approved through a multi-signature system to prevent abuse.

By simulating and testing the inner workings of digital co-ops, this project will give students firsthand experience in DAO tooling, group psychology, and financial coordination. In the long term, CoopDAO could serve as the backend for real-world cooperative platforms seeking modernization through decentralized infrastructure.

   - Design a platform for managing digital co-op activity and membership
- User authentication 
   - Enable wallet-based registration and login to access cooperative tools.
- Smart contracts for wallet-based member registration and proposal voting
   - Implement contracts to track members, votes, and decision outcomes.
- Multi-signature treasury spending system
   - Let members propose and collectively approve spending via smart contracts.
- Admin role assignment and access control
   - Set roles like treasurer, board, or committee with defined permissions.
- Interface for proposing and reviewing expenses
