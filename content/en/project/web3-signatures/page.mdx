title: Web3 Signatures
description: A system where users sign documents or transactions using their wallet signature. Store document hashes on-chain, and optionally save files on IPFS. Others can verify the timestamp, signer identity, and content integrity. Mimics tools like DocuSign but using blockchain authentication that are decentralized and censorship-resistant.

## General Description

[SignChain](https://signchain.monark.io) is a secure, decentralized system for digitally signing documents, agreements, or messages using blockchain wallets. The project allows users to upload a file, generate a content hash, sign it using their private key via wallet integration, and optionally store the signed document hash on-chain or the document itself on IPFS.

Verification is simple: anyone with the document can re-hash it and check against the on-chain or public record to confirm who signed it and when. The system supports multiple signers, time-stamping, and metadata such as document title and category.

This project teaches critical blockchain primitives such as message signing, hash functions, and immutability guarantees. It can be used for grant agreements, employment offers, content licenses, or even internal DAO approvals. Students will gain experience in cryptographic operations, content-based addressing, and dApp frontend flows for non-financial interactions.

The system emphasizes privacy and auditability without centralized document custody, offering a Web3-native alternative to platforms like DocuSign.

## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

- Web interface using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
   - Create a platform where users sign and verify documents on-chain.
- User authentication 
   - Sign in with wallet to access signature tools and history.
- Document upload and content hash generation tool
   - Convert files into hashes for verification and signing.
- Wallet signature flow with on-chain hash commitment
   - Sign file hashes and save proof on blockchain for auditability.
- IPFS integration for optional decentralized storage
   - Optionally upload full files to decentralized storage.
- Web UI for signature validation and document history
- Multi-signer support with timestamps
   - Add multiple wallet signers with accurate timestamps and logs.
