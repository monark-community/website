# DeFi Loans

A lending platform where users deposit collateral and borrow tokens. Smart contracts manage interest, health ratios, and liquidations. Useful to simulate MakerDAO-style loans on testnet. Can include dashboards, alerts, and repayment logic. Emphasizes DeFi risk management and user experience

## General Description

[VaultLend](https://vaultlend.monark.io) simulates a decentralized lending protocol in which users can lock collateral and borrow assets in return. The platform mimics systems like Aave or MakerDAO, but simplified for educational use. Students will implement smart contracts that define collateral types, borrowing limits (loan-to-value ratios), interest accrual, and liquidation thresholds.

Users connect their wallet, lock a test token as collateral, and borrow another token. As market conditions change (or simulated price inputs shift), their "health factor" determines whether their position is safe or at risk of liquidation. Liquidators can repay the debt in exchange for a discounted claim on the collateral.

This system introduces core DeFi concepts: overcollateralization, risk management, stable borrowing, and liquidation incentives. Students also explore compound interest, vault accounting, and multi-token contract design.

VaultLend demonstrates how blockchain replaces traditional intermediaries in lending and helps users learn the foundations of on-chain finance in a secure sandbox.
