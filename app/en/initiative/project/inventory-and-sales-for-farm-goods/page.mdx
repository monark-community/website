# Inventory and Sales for Farm Goods

Design a decentralized system that allows farmers to manage their inventory and sell fruits and vegetables without being physically present. Buyers scan a code at the self-serve stand, interact with a smart contract to purchase produce, and the system updates available stock. Could include mobile UI, local pricing, availability tracking, and optional reward tokens for buyers. Perfect for rural zones and trustless microtransactions.

## General Description

[Bazarius](https://bazarius.monark.io) is a decentralized inventory and payment platform tailored for local farmers and small producers to manage sales without being physically present. The core idea is to enable a trustless self-serve kiosk system where buyers scan a QR code, connect their wallet, and purchase goods—such as fruits or vegetables—directly via a smart contract. The transaction updates the inventory in real time, and the buyer receives a digital confirmation or reward.

This system is particularly well-suited for rural areas where producers may not be available to staff a point of sale but still want to offer fresh, local products. The solution reduces labor costs, increases consumer convenience, and ensures that every transaction is transparent and trackable on-chain. Students will create vendor dashboards to input inventory, pricing, and availability and a buyer-side interface for browsing, selecting, and purchasing items.

Additional functionality can include dynamic pricing based on inventory, loyalty rewards using token incentives, and automated restocking alerts. From a technical perspective, this project teaches smart contract integration with QR-based interfaces, inventory state management, and secure transaction workflows. It also introduces design considerations for mobile-first applications, crucial in kiosk and self-serve environments.

## Deliverables & Desired Functionalities

- Web interface using Next.js, Typescript, shadcn-ui, tailwindcss
    - Deliver a mobile-friendly store for local farm products.
- User authentication 
    - Wallet-based access for farmers (sellers) and buyers.
- Smart contracts to manage product listings, purchases, and inventory updates
    - Auto-update inventory and transfer funds on purchase.
- Vendor dashboard for inventory input and tracking
    - List produce, track sales, and set real-time pricing.
- Buyer interface with QR code support and payment flow
    - Buyers scan a code to buy at the physical stand.
