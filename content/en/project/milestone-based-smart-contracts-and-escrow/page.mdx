# Milestone-Based Smart Contracts and Escrow

Smart contracts that hold funds and release them gradually based on progress. Each milestone is defined upfront with conditions for approval. Think construction contracts, grants, or dev work. Funds unlock when a milestone is validated by the client and/or third-party oracle. Add review flows and progress visualization.

## General Description

[MilestoneMint](https://milestonemint.monark.io) provides a framework for milestone-driven fund distribution, replacing manual escrow and invoicing systems with programmable, rule-based disbursements. The project allows a client to lock funds in a contract, define project phases or deliverables, and release funds only when predefined milestones are reached.

Each milestone can include a description, deadline, percentage of total payment, and validator (e.g., project lead or client). Once validated—manually or by smart contract logic—the funds are unlocked and transferred to the recipient.

This system is especially valuable in sectors like grant funding, independent contractor work, or public infrastructure. It increases trust, transparency, and accountability without centralized control or third-party escrow.

Students building MilestoneMint will gain experience in payout scheduling, role-based permissions, multi-sig approvals, and conditional fund releases. They'll also learn to create UIs for contract monitoring, milestone tracking, and history visualization. This project is ideal for bridging real-world project management workflows with decentralized financial coordination.
